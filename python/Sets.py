# Python Sets:-
# A Python Set is a Collection. Collections in Python include the following: List, Sets, Dictionary and Tuple.

# A Set is a collection in Python
# Set items i.e. elements are placed inside curly braces {}
# Unordered and Unchangeable
# Unchangeable, but you can add/ remove an item
# Duplicate values arenâ€™t allowed in a Set.

for i in myset:
    print(i)
print("The length = ",len(myset))

# Accessing items in Sets
print("maahin" in myset)

# Add an item to Set
myset.add("zakir")
print(myset)

# Add items from another set into the current set
