# Variables in Python are reserved memory locations and do not work like variables in Java, or C. They aren’t declared in the same way. You only need to assign a value in Python, for variable declaration and that’s it! In this lesson, we will learn about Python Variables.
a = 10
b = "Maahin"

print(a)
print(b)

c = 20

sum = a + c
print(sum)
