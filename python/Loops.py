# Python Loops
# Loops execute a block of code and this code executes while the condition is true. In this lesson, we will learn about Python Loops such as while loop, for loop, etc.

# while loop in Python
# In while loop, the block of code executes only when the condition is true. 
# It executes as long as the condition is true.

    # Syntax

# while (condition is true):
#     code

a = 0

while(a < 3):
    print("The value is = ",a)
    a = a + 1

# for loop in Python
# The for loop in Python is used when you can set how many times a statement is to be executed.

# Syntax

# for var in sequence:
#    code

for w in 'Kelvin':
    print("Words in my name = ", w)
