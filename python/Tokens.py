# Python Tokens
# Python Tokens are individual units in a program. The following are the types of Tokens:

# 1.Keywords:-
    # Keywords are reserved words used in programming languages. The compiler/ interpreter already knows these names, so you cannot use them as variable names.
# 2.Identifiers:-
    # Identifiers in Python are used for naming of variables, functions and arrays. Do not use keywords as identifiers.
    # An identifier begins with a letter A to Z or a to z or an underscore (_) followed by zero or more letters, underscores and digits (0 to 9). That means, it is a combination of character digits and underscore.
# 3.Literals:-
    # Literals are the values assigned to each constant variable.
    # Python has the following literals:
        # String Literals: Enclose text in quotes. Can use both single as well as double quotes. Use triple-quotes for multi-line string.
        
str = "Maahin"
print(str)

str = 'Maahin'
print(str)
        # Numeric Literals: Includes int, long, float and complex.

val1 = 10
print(type(val1))
print(val1)

val2 = 'MaahinVimleshPanchal'
print(type(val2))
print(val2)

val3 = 2+5.6j
print(type(val3))

        # Boolean Literals: Can have either True or False values.

val4 = (1 == True)
print(val4)
